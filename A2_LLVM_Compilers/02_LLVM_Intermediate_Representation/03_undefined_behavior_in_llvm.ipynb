    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "LLVM IR has a layered model of undefined behavior, more nuanced than C's single concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immediate Undefined Behavior** — the program has no semantics (e.g., dividing by zero, null dereference). The optimizer may assume this never happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`poison` values** — a deferred form of UB. A `poison` value is produced by operations with undefined results (e.g., `add nsw` that overflows). Using `poison` in certain ways (e.g., as a branch condition, store it to memory) triggers immediate UB. Otherwise, `poison` propagates through computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`undef` values** — represent an arbitrary bit pattern. Each use of `undef` may independently take any value of its type. (Being phased out in favor of `poison`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters for optimization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flags like `nsw` (no signed wrap) and `nuw` (no unsigned wrap) on arithmetic instructions tell the optimizer the operation does not overflow. If it does, the result is `poison`, enabling the optimizer to assume wrapping does not occur and apply transformations like loop induction variable simplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```llvm\n",
    "; nsw = no signed wrap: overflow produces poison\n",
    "%sum = add nsw i32 %a, %b\n",
    "\n",
    "; The optimizer can assume %a + %b does not overflow,\n",
    "; enabling algebraic simplifications.\n",
    "```"
