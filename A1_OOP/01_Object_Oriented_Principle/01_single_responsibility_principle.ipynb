    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** states that every class should encapsulate exactly one responsibility. A *responsibility* is defined as a *reason to change*: if a class can be modified for two independent reasons, it has two responsibilities and should be split.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class mixes unrelated concerns, a change to one concern risks breaking the other. Separating responsibilities isolates change, making code easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Report` class that both computes statistics and formats output for printing violates SRP. If the output format changes (e.g., from plain text to HTML), the statistics logic is unnecessarily exposed to modification risk. Splitting into `ReportStatistics` (computation) and `ReportFormatter` (presentation) isolates each concern."
