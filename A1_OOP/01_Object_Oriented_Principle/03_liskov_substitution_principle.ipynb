    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** states that a subclass must be usable wherever its parent class is expected, without the caller needing to know the difference. The subclass must honor the *behavioral contract* of the parent: same preconditions (or weaker), same postconditions (or stronger), and no new exceptions that the parent does not raise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A violation occurs when a subclass changes the expected semantics of an inherited method — for example, a `Square` subclass of `Rectangle` that couples width and height breaks the independent-dimension contract of `Rectangle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Bird` base class with a `fly` method is problematic if `Penguin` inherits from it, since penguins cannot fly. The caller expects every `Bird` to fly. A correct design separates `FlyingBird` from `Bird`, so `Penguin` only inherits from `Bird` and never promises flight."
