    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** states that existing code should not need to be modified when new behavior is added. Instead, new behavior is introduced by *extending* the existing abstraction — typically through inheritance or composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is closed for modification, its source code is fixed and tested. When it is open for extension, its behavior can be extended without altering the original code. This is achieved by depending on abstractions (base classes or protocols) rather than concrete implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `DiscountCalculator` with `if/elif` branches for each customer type violates OCP: adding a new customer type requires modifying the calculator. Using a base class `Discount` with a `compute` method allows each customer type to define its own discount logic. Adding a new type means adding a new subclass — the calculator itself remains unchanged."
