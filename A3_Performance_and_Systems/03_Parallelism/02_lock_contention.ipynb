    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lock contention** occurs when multiple threads compete to acquire the same lock, serializing what should be parallel work. High contention degrades throughput and can negate the benefit of additional cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contention Taxonomy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Impact |\n",
    "|------|-------------|--------|\n",
    "| Uncontended | Single thread holds lock, no waiters | Low overhead (~20 ns) |\n",
    "| Low contention | Occasional short waits | Acceptable |\n",
    "| High contention | Many threads spin/block on one lock | Near-serial execution |\n",
    "| Convoy | All threads synchronize at lock release | Total serialization |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduce critical section** — hold the lock for the minimum time necessary.\n",
    "2. **Lock striping** — split one lock into many, each protecting a subset of data (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap` uses per-bucket locks).\n",
    "3. **Lock-free data structures** — use atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) instead of locks.\n",
    "4. **Read-write locks** — allow concurrent readers, exclusive writers.\n",
    "5. **Thread-local accumulation** — each thread writes to local storage, merge results after.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Universal Scalability Law (USL):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(n) = \\frac{n}{1 + \\sigma(n-1) + \\kappa \\, n(n-1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the contention penalty and $\\kappa$ is the coherence (crosstalk) penalty. As $n$ grows, throughput can actually *decrease* if $\\kappa > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A shared counter incremented by 8 threads under a global lock runs slower than a single thread (each increment acquires/releases the lock). With thread-local counters merged at the end, contention drops to zero during the work phase."
