    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs)** are special-purpose registers built into the CPU that count micro-architectural events without software instrumentation. They enable precise, low-overhead measurement of what the hardware is actually doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counter Categories:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Example Events |\n",
    "|----------|---------------|\n",
    "| Execution | `instructions`, `cycles`, `branches`, `branch-misses` |\n",
    "| Memory | `cache-references`, `cache-misses`, `L1-dcache-load-misses`, `LLC-load-misses` |\n",
    "| TLB | `dTLB-load-misses`, `iTLB-load-misses` |\n",
    "| Frontend | `frontend-stalls`, `icache-misses` |\n",
    "| Backend | `backend-stalls`, `resource-stalls` |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counter Modes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting** — accumulate total events for the run (`perf stat`).\n",
    "- **Sampling** — interrupt every N events, record the instruction pointer. Build a histogram of hot spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top-Down Microarchitecture Analysis (TMA):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Intel's methodology classifies pipeline slots into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retiring** — slots that produced useful work (good).\n",
    "2. **Bad Speculation** — slots wasted on mispredicted branches.\n",
    "3. **Frontend Bound** — slots lost because the frontend couldn't deliver instructions.\n",
    "4. **Backend Bound** — slots lost because execution units or memory were busy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiplexing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "CPUs have limited counter registers (typically 4–8). When monitoring more events, `perf` time-multiplexes counters and scales the counts, introducing estimation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ perf stat -e L1-dcache-load-misses,LLC-load-misses,dTLB-load-misses ./program\n",
    "    15,000,000  L1-dcache-load-misses\n",
    "     2,000,000  LLC-load-misses       # going to DRAM\n",
    "       500,000  dTLB-load-misses\n",
