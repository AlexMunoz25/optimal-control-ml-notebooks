    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Factory Method** pattern replaces direct constructor calls with a method that subclasses override to produce different product types. The creator class declares the factory method (returning a product interface), and each concrete creator subclass implements it to return a specific product.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decouples the client code from concrete product classes: the client works only with the product interface and the creator's factory method. Adding a new product type means adding a new creator subclass — no existing code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The creator does not know the concrete class of the product it creates.\n",
    "- Each concrete creator overrides the factory method to return a different product.\n",
    "- The client depends only on the abstract product interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A logistics application needs to create different transport objects. A `Logistics` base class defines a `create_transport` factory method. `RoadLogistics` returns `Truck`, `SeaLogistics` returns `Ship`. The planning logic in `Logistics` works identically regardless of transport type."
