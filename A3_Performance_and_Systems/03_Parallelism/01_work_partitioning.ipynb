    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work partitioning** divides a computation across threads or cores so they execute concurrently. The goal is to minimize total wall-clock time while avoiding synchronization overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partitioning Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | Description | Use Case |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| Static (block) | Divide N items into N/P contiguous chunks | Uniform cost per item |\n",
    "| Static (cyclic) | Round-robin assignment | Varying cost, no locality need |\n",
    "| Dynamic | Workers pull from shared queue | Highly variable item cost |\n",
    "| Work-stealing | Idle workers steal from busy workers' queues | Irregular task graphs |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load balance** — even distribution of work across threads. Imbalance means some threads finish early and idle.\n",
    "- **Granularity** — too-fine partitioning wastes time on synchronization; too-coarse limits parallelism.\n",
    "- **Data locality** — partitioning should respect cache structure; threads should access nearby memory.\n",
    "- **Amdahl's Law** — the serial fraction limits maximum speedup regardless of core count.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gustafson's Law (Scaled Speedup):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Speedup} = n - \\alpha(n - 1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the serial fraction. As problem size grows with core count, parallel efficiency can remain high.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing a 1M-element array across 4 threads: split into 4 chunks of 250K, each thread computes a partial sum, then combine the 4 partial sums (a small serial reduction)."
