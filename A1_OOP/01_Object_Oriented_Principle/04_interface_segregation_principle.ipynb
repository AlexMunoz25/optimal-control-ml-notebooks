    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** states that large, monolithic interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to know about the methods relevant to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *fat interface* forces implementors to provide methods they do not need, leading to empty or stub implementations. This creates fragile coupling: changes to unused methods propagate to classes that never call them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, ISP is realized through small abstract base classes or protocols, each defining a narrow contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Worker` interface with `work()`, `eat()`, and `sleep()` forces a `Robot` class to implement `eat()` and `sleep()`, which have no meaning for it. Splitting into `Workable`, `Eatable`, and `Sleepable` interfaces lets `Robot` implement only `Workable`."
