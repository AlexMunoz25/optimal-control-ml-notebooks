    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a pattern where a class receives its dependencies from the outside rather than constructing them internally. The three common injection mechanisms are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constructor injection** — dependencies are passed through the constructor.\n",
    "2. **Setter injection** — dependencies are set via a method after construction.\n",
    "3. **Interface injection** — the dependency provides an injector method that clients call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor injection is the most common and preferred form: it makes dependencies explicit and enforces that the object is fully initialized at construction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "DI is the *mechanism* that realizes the Dependency Inversion Principle. Where DIP is the design guideline (depend on abstractions), DI is the concrete technique (pass abstractions in from outside).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An `OrderService` needs a `PaymentGateway` and a `InventoryChecker`. Instead of creating these internally, it receives them through its constructor. In tests, mock implementations can be injected. In production, real implementations are injected."
