    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** reverses the conventional dependency direction. Instead of high-level policy modules importing and calling low-level implementation modules directly, both depend on a shared abstraction (interface or abstract class). The low-level module *implements* the abstraction, and the high-level module *uses* it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decouples the policy from the mechanism: the high-level module can be tested and deployed independently of the concrete low-level implementation. Swapping implementations (e.g., switching from a file-based store to a database) requires no changes to the high-level module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `NotificationService` that directly instantiates `EmailSender` is tightly coupled to email. If SMS support is needed, the service must be modified. With DIP, `NotificationService` depends on a `MessageSender` abstraction. `EmailSender` and `SmsSender` both implement that abstraction and are injected at construction time."
