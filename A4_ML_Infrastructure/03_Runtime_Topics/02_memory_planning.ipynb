    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory planning** (buffer assignment) determines when and where to allocate/deallocate tensor buffers during compiled model execution. The goal is to minimize peak memory usage while respecting data dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Liveness analysis** — a buffer is live from its definition until its last use. Non-overlapping lifetimes can share the same memory.\n",
    "- **Buffer aliasing** — reuse the input buffer for the output when the op is in-place safe (e.g., elementwise ops).\n",
    "- **Memory fragmentation** — even if total free memory suffices, fragmented free regions may prevent allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**XLA Buffer Assignment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Schedule HLO instructions (topological order with heuristics).\n",
    "2. Compute live ranges for every buffer.\n",
    "3. Assign non-overlapping buffers to the same memory offset (coloring problem).\n",
    "4. Handle constraints: pinned buffers (inputs/outputs), alignment, aliasing hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | Description |\n",
    "|----------|------------|\n",
    "| Greedy by size | Assign largest buffers first, reuse biggest available gap |\n",
    "| Offset assignment | Pack buffers at offsets in a contiguous arena |\n",
    "| Rematerialization | Recompute a value instead of storing it (trade compute for memory) |\n",
    "| Gradient checkpointing | Store only selected activations during forward; recompute the rest during backward |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Three buffers A, B, C where A is live during steps 0–2, B during 1–3, C during 3–5. Buffer A and C have non-overlapping lifetimes → they share the same memory slot."
