    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the compiler auto-vectorizes code, **vectorization reports** let you understand what happened and why. They are essential for diagnosing performance — without them, you are guessing whether your hot loops use SIMD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compiler Flags:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Compiler | Flag | Output |\n",
    "|----------|------|--------|\n",
    "| Clang/LLVM | `-Rpass=loop-vectorize` | Reports successful vectorizations |\n",
    "| Clang/LLVM | `-Rpass-missed=loop-vectorize` | Reports failed vectorizations with reason |\n",
    "| Clang/LLVM | `-Rpass-analysis=loop-vectorize` | Detailed cost model analysis |\n",
    "| GCC | `-fopt-info-vec-optimized` | Reports successful vectorizations |\n",
    "| GCC | `-fopt-info-vec-missed` | Reports failed vectorizations |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Failure Reasons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loop-carried dependency** — iteration N depends on iteration N-1.\n",
    "- **Non-contiguous memory access** — pointer aliasing or indirect indexing.\n",
    "- **Function call in loop body** — unless the callee is inlined or has a vector variant.\n",
    "- **Complex control flow** — multiple exits, exceptions, or unpredictable branches.\n",
    "- **Insufficient trip count** — loop too short to benefit from SIMD overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pragmas for Guidance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#pragma clang loop vectorize(enable)         // encourage vectorization\n",
    "#pragma clang loop vectorize_width(8)        // request VF=8\n",
    "#pragma clang loop interleave_count(4)       // request IC=4\n",
    "__attribute__((noinline)) void f();           // prevent inlining\n",
    "void g() __attribute__((assume_aligned(32))); // promise alignment\n",
